      <p className="max-w-2xl text-justify text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Hi, I’m Miguel Zepeda. Originally from Texas, I’ve called Arizona home
        since 2008. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong passion for software
        and building thoughtful, user-focused solutions.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-2xl mt-6 text-justify text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I currently work as a Business Analyst at a software company in the
        self-storage industry, where I manage team backlogs, write user stories,
        and lead meetings to keep projects moving smoothly. I hold a Bachelor of
        Science in Software Development from Grand Canyon University, and my
        background bridges both business and technical perspectives — helping me
        communicate effectively across teams and contribute to well-rounded
        product decisions.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-2xl mt-6 text-justify text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I’m always learning and evolving, with a growing focus on development. I
        believe that my combined experience in business analysis and software
        development allows me to bring a unique and valuable perspective to
        every project.
